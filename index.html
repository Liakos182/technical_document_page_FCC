            <p>The Fender Percision bass, is the <i>first modern electric bass</i> brought in to production by the ingenius Leo Fender. 
                The instrument had a major impact on modern music.Now days you still purches a Fender Precision bass,
                 or many of its knock-off that are widley availible in music stores.
                In this web site you will get instruction about how to set up your Percision bass (original or counterfit, as long as it has a scale-distance between nut and bridge-is 34 inches). </p>
            <p>Its important for any stringed instrument to be properly set up.A badly set up instrument will be a chalenge to play and might also sound band.
                A bolt-on solid body instruement with one pickup like the Fender Precision bass is fairly easy to set up,and it will take about 40 minutes to set it up by somone who hasen't done it before.
            </p>
            <p>In order to set up your P-bass you should have these tools,which are quiet common:</p>

            <p>So you got your self your P-bass, brand new?Second hand?Just dug it out from the attic?
                None the less it still needs a good set-up if it has been standing uplayed for a while.
                I like to do a rough check out of its set up at first, check relif action and intontation, 
                to aproximate what will need to be done.After that we will take off the strings(even if its a brand new instrument
                I would discard its factory strings for a fresh set-reamember the best upgrade you can do to your bass is fresh strings).
            </p>
            <p>Now with the strings off its time to give your bass a good clean.Use the wood polish to clean the body, neck and headstock of your instrument with an unlinted cloath.
                Use silver polish with microfiber cloath the polish your frets.You can use silver polish to polish the "nickel" parts of your bass (ie tunning pegs and bridge).
                There are two types of frettboard on a P-bass,
                 its either maple, or Rosewood(or rosewood substitutes).
                How do you tell them apart?maple is white, while rosewood(and substitutes) are dark.
                If your frettboard is maple just use the wood polish to clean it.If its rosewood, you put some lemon oil on a paper towel, wait for 
                15minutes to half an hour and swipe away any residue. Was you hands afterwords.
                Now with the strings off is a good time to do any rough adjustments to the instrument.
            </p>

            <p>Now that you have the strings off the instrument its a good time to get it nice and lubed.
                Use the mechanical pencil on the nut.Rub the graphite on the string slots of the nut till they are completly black.
                Spay some light machine oil on a paper towel and rub it on the bridge where the strings slots are.

            <p>Now that the bass is clean and lubed its time to put your fresh strings on.
Put the strings on tune up your bass. Affix a capo at the first fret and depress the fourth string at the last fret. 
With a feeler gauge, check the gap between the bottom of the string and the top of the 8th fret—see the spec chart below for the proper gap.
Caution: Because of the amount of string tension on the neck, you should loosen the strings before adjusting the truss rod. After the adjustment is made, re-tune the strings and re-check the gap with the feeler gauge.
Adjustment at headstock (allen wrench): Sight down the edge of the fingerboard from behind the headstock, looking toward the body of the instrument. If the neck is too concave (action too high), turn the truss rod nut clockwise to remove excess relief. If the neck is too convex (strings too close to the fingerboard), turn the truss rod nut counter-clockwise to allow the string tension to pull more relief into the neck. Check your tuning, then re-check the gap with the feeler gauge and re-adjust as needed.
Adjustment at neck joint (phillips screwdriver): Sight down the edge of the fingerboard from behind the body, looking up toward the headstock of the instrument. 
If the neck is too concave (action too high), turn the truss rod nut clockwise to remove excess relief. If the neck is too convex (strings too close to the fingerboard), turn the truss rod nut counter-clockwise to allow the string tension to pull more relief into the neck. 
Check your tuning, then re-check the gap with the feeler gauge and re-adjust as needed.

            <p>Players with a light touch can get away with lower action; others need higher action to avoid rattles. First, check tuning. Using a 6" (150 mm) ruler, measure the distance between bottom of strings and top of the 17th fret. Adjust bridge saddles to the height to 6/64" (2.4 mm)</p>

            <p>Adjustments should be made after all of the above have been accomplished. Set the pickup selector switch (if your bass has one) in the middle position, and turn the volume and tone controls to their maximum settings. Check tuning. Check each string at the 12th fret, harmonic to fretted note (make sure you are depressing the string evenly to the fret, not the fingerboard). If sharp, lengthen the string by adjusting the saddle back. If flat, shorten the string by moving the saddle forward. Remember, basses are tempered instruments! Re-tune, play and make further adjustments as needed.</p>
